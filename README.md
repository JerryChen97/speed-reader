# Speed Reader

Paste the text you want to speedread, and click the **Read!** button. Additionally, you can set the reading speed, but the default 200 words per minute is optimal for an untrained reader.

You can pause the reading by pressing **P** or **Space**.

I'll add more features in the future, such as:

- More options
- A bookmarklet
- Responsive layout for mobiles, tablets, etc.
- [x] Night mode
