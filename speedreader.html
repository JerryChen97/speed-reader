            <textarea id="text-to-read">Wikipedia: Speed reading is the name for a number of ways to increase the speed at which a text can be read, so that the important facts of the text can still be understood. There are different ways to improve reading speed, but they are all similar. A trained reader is able to read and understand between 200 and 300 words per minute, for a text that is not very difficult to understand. Better training can improve this speed to over 1000 words per minute. Using a lot of exercise, it is possible to increase reading speed further. The best readers can read between 3000 and 4000 words per minute, and understand about 80% of them.</textarea>

                <p>Paste the text you want to speedread, and click the <em>Read!</em> button. Additionally, you can set the reading speed, but the default 200 words per minute is optimal for an untrained reader.

                <p>You can pause the reading by pressing <em>P</em> or <em>Space</em>.</p>
